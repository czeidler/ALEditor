Load Layout Example

Demonstrates how a layout specification created with ALE can be loaded into an application.

To build the example copy the example folder somewhere into your home directory. Open the folder in a terminal and build it:

cmake . && make

(If you prefer the haiku makefile engine just rename makefile_haiku to makefile and call make.)

FYI: You can open the TestLayout file with ALE to change the layout.
